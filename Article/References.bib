abstract = {Several classification schemes for penile precancerous lesions have been proposed, but none of them seems to correlate with the current understanding of penile cancer pathogenesis. Recently, a system, which takes into account morphologic features and purported etiopathogenesis, was proposed, separating penile intraepithelial neoplasia (PeIN) in differentiated and warty/basaloid subtypes. This study was designed to seek an immunohistochemical profile that can be helpful in the classification and differential diagnosis of penile epithelial abnormalities and precancerous lesions using the aforementioned system. The immunohistochemical panel included stains for p16, p53, and Ki-67. For p16 immunostaining, only full-thickness positivity in all epithelial cells was considered as positive; for p53 and Ki-67 immunostaining, patchy or diffuse nuclear positivity above the basal layer was considered as positive. Seventy-four lesions in 59 patients were selected and classified as follows: differentiated PeIN, 34 cases; squamous hyperplasia (SH), 21 cases; basaloid PeIN, 15 cases; and warty PeIN, 4 cases. The mean age of patients was 64 years. Forty-two lesions (56.8\%) were located in the glans and 32 (43.2\%) in the foreskin. Overexpression of p16 was useful for distinguishing SH from warty/basaloid PeINs (0\% vs. 94.7\%, P<0.0001) but not SH from differentiated PeINs (0\% vs. 5.9\%, P=0.519). In addition, p16 allowed the distinction of differentiated and warty/basaloid PeINs (5.9\% vs. 94.7\%, P<0.0001). Immunohistochemistry results for p53 allowed the separation of SH and differentiated PeIN (9.5\% vs. 44.1\%, P=0.0078) and SH and warty/basaloid PeIN (9.5\% vs. 55.6\%, P=0.0042). Ki-67 immunostain was useful for distinguishing SH from differentiated PeIN (52.6\% vs. 89.7\%, P=0.0062) and SH from PeIN with warty and/or basaloid features (52.6\% vs. 100\%, P=0.0011). There seems to be a distinctive immunohistochemical profile for associated and precursor epithelial lesions of the penis. SH was p16 and p53 negative, with variable Ki-67 positivity. Differentiated PeIN was p16 negative and Ki-67 positive, with variable p53 positivity. Basaloid and warty PeINs were consistently p16 and Ki-67 positive, with variable p53 positivity. The use of a triple p16/p53/Ki-67 immunohistochemical panel was found to be helpful in the classification, differential diagnosis, and morphologic standardization of penile intraepithelial lesions.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prognostic significance of p53, Ki-67, epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in primary penile cancer, as the presence of lymph node metastasis and long-term survival are hard to define in penile squamous cell carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Paraffin-embedded primary tumour samples were obtained from 73 Chinese patients who had penile amputation and regional lymphadenectomy. The expression of molecular markers was determined by immunohistochemistry. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with lymph node metastasis, and a Cox proportional-hazards model was used to measure cancer-specific survival (CSS). RESULTS: Thirty (41\%) patients presented with nodal disease and the 3-year CSS rate for all patients was 72\%. Lymph node metastasis was significantly correlated with tumour stage, histological grade, lymphatic and vascular embolization, and the expression of p53, Ki-67 and E-cadherin. By multivariate analysis, tumour embolization and the expression of p53 were independent predictors of metastasis. Survival analysis showed that the expression of p53 was an independent prognostic factor for CSS. In stage T1 tumours, high expression of p53 was significantly associated with metastasis and poor survival. CONCLUSION: Lymphatic and vascular embolization, and p53 immunoreactivity, are helpful in establishing the probability of lymph node metastasis. The expression of p53 is an independent predictor of CSS in Chinese patients with penile cancer. In stage T1 tumours, p53 staining is an important variable determining the prognosis and treatment outcome.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: We examined p53 protein and proliferating cell nuclear antigen immunoexpression as prognostic factors to the outcome of squamous cell carcinoma of the penis in 50 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Penectomy and lymphadenectomy were performed in 14 patients with clinically positive nodes while 36 with cN0 disease were treated with penectomy and kept under surveillance that resulted in subsequent lymphadenectomy due to nodal relapse in 8. Of 21 patients with confirmed nodal metastases 18 died of disease. Immunohistochemical reactions were performed via the avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase method and the results were compared with tumor pT stage, grade, nodal status and cause specific death. RESULTS: In univariate analysis proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining showed association only with nodal metastasis (p = 0.04) while p53 staining exhibited correlation with tumor pT stage (p = 0.0005), grade (p = 0.02), lymphatic spread (p = 0.02) and cause specific survival (p = 0.003). Multivariate analysis showed that p53 immunoreactivity was the only factor with prognostic significance for disease progression and cause specific survival. Tumor pT stage, grade and proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining had no significance for nodal metastases and cause specific death. CONCLUSIONS: Proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining had no prognostic value for disease progression. Since p53 over expression was associated with tumor progression and cause specific death, perhaps it should be evaluated in staging and therapeutic planning for patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the penis.},

abstract = {There is evidence that a subset of penile carcinomas is caused by infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV). However, extensive studies on the possible influence of HPV infection on clinical outcome of penile cancer are lacking. This investigation is aimed to examine the prevalence of high-risk HPV in a large series of penile squamous-cell carcinomas (SCCs) and to determine the relationship between HPV and survival. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor specimens of 171 patients with penile carcinoma were tested for high-risk HPV DNA presence by GP5+/6+-PCR. The clinical course of the patients and the histopathological characteristics of the primary tumors were reviewed. High-risk HPV DNA was detected in 29\% of the tumors, with HPV 16 being the predominant type, accounting for 76\% of high-risk HPV containing SCCs. Disease-specific 5-year survival in the high-risk HPV-negative group and high-risk HPV-positive group was 78\% and 93\%, respectively (log rank test p = 0.03). In multivariate analysis, the HPV status was an independent predictor for disease-specific mortality (p = 0.01) with a hazard ratio of 0.14 (95\% CI: 0.03-0.63). Our results indicate that the presence of high-risk HPV (29\%) confers a survival advantage in patients with penile carcinoma.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Gold standard treatment for invasive penile carcinoma remains amputation and lymphadenectomy. This procedure has high morbidity and new prognostic factors on the incidence of metastasis would help select candidates to lymphadenectomy. Mutations in the p53 gene common in several neoplasms can be related to the prognosis. We studied 82 patients with penile carcinoma staged according to the 1978 TNM system who underwent amputation and bilateral lymphadenectomy to evaluate the prognostic value of immunohistochemical p53 staining in the primary tumor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunoreactivity of p53 was studied with other clinicopathological variables, including patient age, stage, histological grade, tumor thickness, lymphatic and venous embolization, corpora cavernosa, corpus spongiosum and urethral infiltration, and human papillomavirus (HPV) status. We also determined its association with lymph node metastasis, the survival rate and the risk of death. In addition, we studied the association of p53 and HPV DNA with prognosis. All slides were reviewed by 1 pathologist. HPV DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction using GP5/6+ generic primers. p53 expression was measured by immunohistochemical testing with monoclonal Clone DO-7 mouse anti-human p53 protein antibody (Dako A/S, Glostrup, Denmark). The Cox regression hazards method was used for multifactorial analysis. RESULTS: Nuclear accumulation of p53 was detected in 34 of 82 samples (41.5\%). Clinical lymph node N stage (p = 0.045), lymphatic (p <0.001) and venous (p = 0.04) embolization by neoplastic cells, p53 positivity (p = 0.012) and p53 grade (p = 0.004) were significantly associated with lymph node metastasis. Followup was 0.1 to 453 months (mean 88.7). Multivariate analysis revealed that only lymphatic embolization (relative risk 9.4, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 2.8 to 31.6) and p53 positivity (relative risk 4.8, 95\% CI 1.6 to 14.9) were independent factors for lymph node metastasis. Patients with negative p53 had significantly better 5 and 10-year overall survival than those in whom tumors stained positive for p53 (64.5\% and 54.6\% versus 30.2\% and 26.4\%, respectively, p = 0.009). When tumors were p53 positive and HPV DNA positive, overall survival was worse. Multivariate analysis revealed that only age (relative risk 2.9, 95\% CI 1.6 to 5.1) and lymph node metastasis (relative risk 3.2, 95\% CI 1.8 to 5.8) were independent risk factors for death. CONCLUSIONS: Immunoreactivity of p53 is an independent factor for lymph node metastasis. The association of positive p53 with positive HPV DNA was related to a worse prognosis.},

abstract = {Mutations in the evolutionarily conserved codons of the p53 tumor suppressor gene are common in diverse types of human cancer. The p53 mutational spectrum differs among cancers of the colon, lung, esophagus, breast, liver, brain, reticuloendothelial tissues, and hemopoietic tissues. Analysis of these mutations can provide clues to the etiology of these diverse tumors and to the function of specific regions of p53. Transitions predominate in colon, brain, and lymphoid malignancies, whereas G:C to T:A transversions are the most frequent substitutions observed in cancers of the lung and liver. Mutations at A:T base pairs are seen more frequently in esophageal carcinomas than in other solid tumors. Most transitions in colorectal carcinomas, brain tumors, leukemias, and lymphomas are at CpG dinucleotide mutational hot spots. G to T transversions in lung, breast, and esophageal carcinomas are dispersed among numerous codons. In liver tumors in persons from geographic areas in which both aflatoxin B1 and hepatitis B virus are cancer risk factors, most mutations are at one nucleotide pair of codon 249. These differences may reflect the etiological contributions of both exogenous and endogenous factors to human carcinogenesis.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Penile cancer is a rare tumour in developed countries but more common in South America and East Africa. Although pathological prognostic factors have been established, there is great interest in evaluating molecular markers which correlate with prognosis and outcome. METHODS: We have reviewed the current status of our understanding of the molecular biology of penile cancer in order to identify established and potential prognostic factors in penile cancer. We have conducted an extensive literature search to review the current understanding of the role of prognostic markers in penile cancer. RESULTS: Although several markers have been evaluated, currently the clinical application of these markers is limited. HPV positive tumours show a variable prognostic outcome. P53 status may correlate with survival in T1 disease but further studies are required to establish the link to lymph node spread. CONCLUSIONS: Pathological variables are well-established but further work is required to investigate the role of molecular markers. The development of molecular prognostic markers is important for the surveillance of patients and prediction of lymph node involvement as well as a prognostic marker for survival.},

abstract = {Inguinal lymph node metastasis is the single most important factor for predicting survival in patients with penile squamous cell carcinomas. To estimate the likelihood of this event, investigators have combined pathologic features of the primary tumor in the form of stratification systems. In this article we review 3 such systems (Solsona et al, J Urol 2001;165:1506; Hungerhuber et al, Urology 68:621, 2006; and Chaux et al, Am J Surg Pathol 2009;33:1049) built upon histologic grade, extent and depth of tumor invasion, and perineural invasion. We evaluate their usefulness, limitations, and possible implications for the management of patients with penile cancer. We also provide clues for the proper identification and interpretation of these pathologic features. Inguinal metastases were observed in 64\% to 83\% of patients in high-risk groups, 20\% to 33\% of intermediate groups, and 0\% to 8\% of low-risk groups. The results of these studies suggest that patients in high-risk groups could benefit from prophylactic bilateral groin dissection. In addition, patients in low-risk groups might be managed by surveillance alone. Finally, the authors suggest that additional approaches, such as sentinel lymph node biopsy, should be used for the intermediate-risk group. The identification of other pathologic features, such as vascular and perineural invasion, could tip the scales in problematic or paradoxical cases. The fate of these risk groups would be better defined by the identification of molecular biomarkers and genetic profiling.},

abstract = {The incidence of penile cancer varies from country to country, with the highest figures reported for countries in Africa, South America, and Asia and lowest in the United States and Europe. Causes of this variation are not clear, but they are thought to be related to human papillomavirus infection, smoking, lack of circumcision, chronic inflammation, and poor genital hygiene. Most penile tumors are squamous cell carcinomas, and a variegated spectrum of distinct morphologies is currently recognized. Each one of these subtypes has distinctive pathologic and clinical features. About half of penile carcinomas are usual squamous cell carcinomas, and the rest corresponds to verrucous, warty, basaloid, warty-basaloid, papillary, pseudohyperplastic, pseudoglandular, adenosquamous, sarcomatoid, and cuniculatum carcinomas. Previous studies have found a consistent association of tumor cell morphology and human papillomavirus presence in penile carcinomas. Those tumors composed of small- to intermediate-sized, basaloid ("blue") cells are often human papillomavirus positive, whereas human papillomavirus prevalence is lower in tumors showing large, keratinizing, maturing eosinophilic ("pink") cells. Human papillomavirus-related tumors affect younger patients, whereas human papillomavirus-unrelated tumors are seen in older patients with phimosis, lichen sclerosus, or squamous hyperplasia. This morphologic distinctiveness is also observed in penile intraepithelial neoplasia. The specific aim of this review is to provide a detailed discussion on the macroscopic and microscopic features of all major subtypes of penile cancer. We also discuss the role of pathologic features in the prognosis of penile cancer, the characteristics of penile precursor lesions, and the use of immunohistochemistry for the diagnosis of invasive and precursor lesions. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.
